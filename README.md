# DeiWorks Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my DeiWorks portfolio! This portfolio showcases my skills and expertise in videography and web development. In this README, I'll provide insights into my development process, challenges encountered, and lessons learned while creating this portfolio.

## Process

### Planning
Before diving into development, I spent time brainstorming and outlining the key features and design elements I wanted to incorporate into my portfolio. This included defining the layout, selecting color schemes, and identifying the technologies I'd use.

### Development
I began by setting up the basic structure of the portfolio using HTML and styling it with CSS. Then, I integrated Bootstrap to streamline the development process and ensure responsiveness across various devices.

### Challenges

#### Responsive Design
Achieving responsive design was one of the major challenges I faced. Ensuring that the portfolio looked and performed well across different screen sizes and devices required careful planning and implementation.

- Offcanvas navigation for mobile devices
- Instagram link integration
- Contact form
- Schema.org markup for better SEO

### Overcoming Challenges
To overcome these challenges, I leveraged online resources, such as documentation and forums, to gain insights and solutions from the web development community. Additionally, I conducted extensive testing using browser developer tools and online testing platforms to identify and address compatibility issues systematically.

## Lessons Learned
Creating my web portfolio was a valuable learning experience that taught me several important lessons:
- The importance of planning and wireframing before diving into development.
- The significance of responsive design and its impact on user experience.
- The benefits of leveraging frameworks and libraries to streamline development and enhance productivity.
